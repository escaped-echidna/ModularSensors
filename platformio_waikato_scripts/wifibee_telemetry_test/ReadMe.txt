This is a test of the Wifibee v.01 from DF robot on the Mayfly, using on-board sensors (for temperature and battery voltage). 

This script was used to successfully send data to monitorymywatershed.org (to the UoW_test site) connecting the mayfly to a wifi hotspot. First successful test was on 30/07/2019.

In order to run this script, it is necessary first to sync the clock on the Mayfly and attach both a SD card and a small coin battery (to prevent the clock from losing synchronisation when the Mayfly is offline. 

It is also necessary to assure the wifibee has the correct firmware. There are instructions for updating the wifi bee firmware in the folder 'modem_firmware.'
